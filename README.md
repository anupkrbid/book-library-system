# Book Library System

> This is a classic online book library that has all the features of a physical library. This online book library system is user friendly and easy to understand.

## Features

- Adding the book with details like book name, book description, count and author.
- Searching the book.
- Editing a particular book detail.
- Also create a page with the list of all the books listed in the system.

## Tech

Book Library System uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Angular] - An application design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps.
- [NgRx] - Reactive State for Angular, built on top of RxJs.
- [Webpack] - An open-source JavaScript module bundler.
- [Node.js] - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and an evented I/O for the backend.
- [Express] - A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- [Nodemon] - A tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.


And of course Book Library System itself is open source with a [public repository][git-repo-url] on GitHub.

## Installation

Book Library System requires [Node.js] v10+ to run.
Clone the repository and install the dependencies and devDependencies and follow the development steps.
